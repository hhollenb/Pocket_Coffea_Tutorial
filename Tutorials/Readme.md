# Introductory Tutorial: Fundamentals for pocket-coffea - Reconstructing the Z Boson

## Introduction: 

### Why this tutorial?

Pocket-coffea is a powerful analysis framework that allows us to scale our particle physics analyses efficiently. However, to truly understand how it works and to be able to debug our own analyses, it is crucial to master the fundamental tools on which it is built.

In this tutorial, we will perform a complete analysis "by hand" using the key libraries of the Python scientific ecosystem for High Energy Physics (uproot, awkward, hist). We will reconstruct the Z boson, visualize it and measure its properties.

Upon completion of this exercise, you will not only have performed a start-to-finish analysis, but you will also have a thorough understanding of what problems pocket-coffea solves and be ready to use it with complete confidence.

### Final objective:

* Perform a manual analysis of the Z disintegration to $\mu +$ $\mu -$.

* Understand the basic workflow: loading, selection, calculation and visualization.

* Measure the properties of the Z boson by model fitting.
